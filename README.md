# Supabase Docker Compose Environment

Supabase is a very good tool, with pretty decent services around it that
eases my development when creating projects, but there's one thing that it
sucks: CI/CD.

At the moment there's no good tooling around to manage your supabase
locally, therefor the need for creating a template environment to add to
your project.
