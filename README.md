# supabase-starter

I felt like creating my own tooling for managing supabase projects, will add
more stuff here while using this template.

**Unfinished**:

- [ ] Add a `test:sql` command that runs `pgtap` on the postgres container
  (it's already installed).
- [ ] Add default tables & necessary procedures that are common between
  projects
- [ ] Add a example of an app
- [ ] Add a tool to push changes local schema to a remote database
